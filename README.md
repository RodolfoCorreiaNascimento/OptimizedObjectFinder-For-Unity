# OptimizedObjectFinder-For-Unity
A script in C# to use Unity methods more efficiently, making the processing cost very low and your codes using the GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag and GameObject.Find methods much more efficient, as we know that searching for Strings generates high costs, remembering that the scene objects for this Tool need to be named this way ex: 1-sword, 2-shield, 3-fire in this way you probably are going to generate a sucess binary search for your object.

This implemetation I found when I was studing c++ data structs on CodeWars and I manage to use it in Unity. Thank you so much use it as many times as you can be happy making cool games! :)
